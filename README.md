# PerlCNF

Perl based Configuration Network File Format Parser and Specifications.
CNF file format supports used format extraction from any text file.
Useful for templates and providing initial properties and values for an application settings.

This version doesn't parse the actual __DATA__ section of an perl file yet. Contact me if this is needed, and for any other possible, useful requests.
