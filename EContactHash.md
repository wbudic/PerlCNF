# Electronic Contact Hash

   This is a special contact hash, used to contact someone over the net securely.
   Having this hash provides a one-direction sending of a message to that contact.
   That message can contain your contact email, phone number, whatever.
   For further normal correspondence.

   This requires a web service, which unfortunately has not been enabled for this project.

   The approximate date of enabling this service is **2023-Dec-01**.

   *Thanks, for your interest*,
