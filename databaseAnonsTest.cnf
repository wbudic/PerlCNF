    Parser would in the past classify anons as automatic META instructions. This not anymore the case.
    Following was in the past to be called with $parser->anon('GET_SUB_URL',[One,Two]) 
    to dynamically macro translate via arguments to the anon function.
    Note - This is not anymore how this is best or only way to be done. as using hashes or the MACRO instruction is better.

    Following is the in future hierarchical planed property format example.
    For CNF3.0+
    Accessed lke: $parser->anon('MyDoc/Node1');
    or if called with $parser->anon('MyDoc/') will return private list of nodes. 
    While calling $parser->anon('MyDoc'), will return it value, which again can be anything.
    Reason for the folding '{{{' is obvious, the property value could contain 
    itself brackets, we do not need to escape within the CNF script format.
    Same with quotes, CNF script is not JSON, it is oblivious about those thanks to its intelligent design.
    Doesn't need them.
