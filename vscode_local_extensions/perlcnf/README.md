# PerlCNF MS Visual Studio Code Extension

This is the extension that formats PerlCNF files that have the cnf Extension.
It is recommended to start vscode to view and work with CNF from a fresh and local extensions directory.
From the command line in the PerlCNF project directory type:

```bash
   code --extensions-dir ./vscode_local_extensions/
```

* You will need then to install the following extensions:
  * Perl Language Server (PLS) - Fractalboy
  * Perl - Language Debugger -  Gerald Richter
  * Perl Navigator - bscan
  * Better Perl Syntax - Jeff Hykin

When you open some **CNF** file, then you might need to associate it with the new format.
This is done with Select Language Mode (`Ctrl+K M` on Windows and Linux),
or click on the file type in the editors footer.

Then type **PerlCNF**, if it doesn't appear, it means something went wrong starting or locating the extension.
